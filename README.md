# bitlbee-otr3

This is a standalone OTR plugin for bitlbee that uses libotr3 instead of libotr4, so you can build it for your dinosaurs.

It's actually a copy of the code used in 3.2.1 (the last version to use libotr3) packaged as a standalone plugin.

You probably don't want to use this - bitlbee includes an otr plugin that uses libotr4.
